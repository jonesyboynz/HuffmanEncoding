Three rings for the elven kings under the sky
Seven for the dwarf lords in their halls of stone
Nine rings for mortal men doomed to die
One for the dark lord on his dark throne

In the land of Mordor where shadows lie, one ring to rule them all.

One ring to find them, one ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.

-JRR Tolkien
